# Sudoku-Solver

Sudoku solver written in python, the code uses bactracking to find the solution to a given sudoku board (you will notice that i also added a function to get user input for the board), the program prints both the initial board and the solution.
it is a nice and fun way to learn about backtracking and the implementation is not complicated, its a fun way to appreciate the thinking behind backtracking and also the writing of the code is fun and light, and its a cool thing to show you non coding friends.
also, you can add a gui if you would like, and it can be a good way to learn about the implementation of gui in python and enhance you self learning skills.

*Edit*:
also added a cpp implementation of a solver
